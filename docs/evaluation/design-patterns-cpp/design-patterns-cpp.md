# Analysis of C++ Code Object-Oriented Metrics for design-patterns-cpp

**Report Date:** 14.04.2025  
**Repository URL:** https://github.com/JakubVojvoda/design-patterns-cpp

---

- **NUMBER_OF_FILES:** 24  
- **NUMBER_OF_CLASSES:** 104  
  *A normal file count and a significant number of classes.*
- **ATTRIBUTE_HIDING_FACTOR:** 1.0  
  *All attributes are hidden, so internal data is encapsulated.*
- **METHOD_HIDING_FACTOR:** 0.01  
  *Almost all methods are public, allowing broad access to class functionalities.*
- **ATTRIBUTE_INHERITANCE_FACTOR:** 0.09  
  *Only a small number of attributes  are inherited, which means that many classes define their own attributes to demonstrate distinct design patterns.*
- **METHOD_INHERITANCE_FACTOR:** 0.34  
  *Approximately one-third of the methods are inherited, showing selective reuse of behavior.*
- **POLYMORPHISM_FACTOR:** 0.91  
  *A very high polymorphism factor, as expected in a design patterns repository.*

- **AVERAGE_DEPTH_OF_INHERITANCE_TREE:** 0.49  
  *A low average depth of inheritance.*
- **AVERAGE_NUMBER_OF_CHILDREN:** 0.52  
  *A low average number of children.*

- **AVERAGE_RESPONSE_FOR_A_CLASS:** 3.79  
  *Limited set of responses per class, which keeps each design pattern example easier to understand.*
- **AVERAGE_NUMBER_OF_MESSAGES:** 2.88  
  *Low number of interactions, keeping clarity in design examples.*
