---

- **NUMBER_OF_FILES:** 4  
- **NUMBER_OF_CLASSES:** 28  
  *A small file count and a moderate number of classes indicates a lightweight implementation.*
- **ATTRIBUTE_HIDING_FACTOR:** 0.96  
  *Nearly all attributes are hidden, so internal data is encapsulated.*
- **METHOD_HIDING_FACTOR:** 0.09  
  *Most methods are public, allowing broad access to class functionalities.*
- **ATTRIBUTE_INHERITANCE_FACTOR:** 0.51  
- **METHOD_INHERITANCE_FACTOR:** 0.5  
  *About half of the attributes and methods are inherited, suggesting a balanced reuse of data members.*
- **POLYMORPHISM_FACTOR:** 0.41  
  *A moderate polymorphism factor allows to flex behavior.*
- **AVERAGE_DEPTH_OF_INHERITANCE_TREE:** 0.19  
  *A very low average depth of inheritance.*
- **AVERAGE_NUMBER_OF_CHILDREN:** 0.5  
  *A low average number of children.*

- **AVERAGE_RESPONSE_FOR_A_CLASS:** 29.65  
- **AVERAGE_NUMBER_OF_MESSAGES:** 45.12  
  *A high average response and number of messages indicates  that, when an object is messaged, it has many potential methods to execute.*
